/**
 * @mainpage BioTools++
 * @version 1.0
 * @author Carsten Kemena, 2012.
 *
 *
 * This suite provides a number of tools to produce and evaluate multiple sequence alignments. Furthermore
 * it contains extensive documentation so that all function can be easily used in other projects.
 *
 * Currently the following tools are implemented:
 * \warning All programs are still in alpha or early beta status.
 *
 * \par MSAA - Multiple Sequence Alignment Analyzer
 * This program provides several methods to reformat and analyze multiple sequence alignments.
 *
 * \par maskHelper
 * This program can merge several masked files into one and change soft- to hardmasking and vice versa.
 *
 * \par tea
 * This a simple reimplementation of the default mode of T-Coffee. One can choose between different modes to
 * produce the pairwise library.
